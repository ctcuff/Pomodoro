# Pomodoro
This is a small project I made to help me study. The main idea of the Pomodoro technique is to have 25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5 minute break. This app starts a timer for 25 minutes and immediately starts another for 5 minutes once that stops. Work and break duration can be changed throught the settings.

_There's a neat little animation when the work/break session changes_:
